# Project Documentation

This repository contains two distinct sets of documentation for two different audiences:

1.  **For Template Users:** If you want to use or extend the Go templates and the automation framework, the guides in this section are for you.
    *   **[Factory Guide](./guides/factory-guide.md):** Explains how to use the `task` commands.

2.  **For Process Observers:** If you are interested in the AI-led development methodology (THEA) that was used to build this project, the documents in this section provide a deep dive into our process.
    *   **[THEA Process & Methodology](./thea-process/README.md):** An index of our team handbooks, playbooks, and reference materials.
