# WHAT: Exports a comprehensive snapshot of the entire project, organized
#       by our "products, factory, docs" architectural model.
# WHY:  Provides a complete, structured context file for high-level AI
#       analysis, onboarding, or architectural review.

# --- Main Logic ---

echo "--> Generating full project export to $OUTPUT_FILE..."

# 1. Start the report with a clear, hardcoded prompt.
cat <<EOF > "$OUTPUT_FILE"
# AI INSTRUCTION: Full Project Context Analysis

## 1. Your Role
Assume the role of a senior software engineer and technical architect. Your memory is now being initialized with the complete state of a software project.

## 2. Your Task
The content immediately following this prompt is a comprehensive export of the project, organized by its architectural model. Your primary task is to **fully ingest and internalize this entire context**.

## 3. Required Confirmation
After you have processed all the information, your **only** response should be a confirmation message like "Context loaded."
